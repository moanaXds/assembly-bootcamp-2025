Day 1! Getting Started with Assembly
------------------------------------

On Day 1, I set up my Assembly programming environment using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Irvine32 library to run my very first Assembly code.

I learned:
----------
How to write and run Assembly programs in Visual Studio.

How to link Irvine32.lib for easy access to I/O procedures.

How to debug step by step, observing how registers and memory values change.

How operations like multiplication, division, subtraction work at the CPU instruction level.


I also included screenshots of each step to clearly show:
--------------------------------------------------------
How the code is executed line by line.

How register values change after each instruction.

How arithmetic instructions affect results in real time.


This day marks the beginning of a from-scratch journey to mastering Assembly language.
